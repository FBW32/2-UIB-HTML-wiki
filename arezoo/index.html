    <h1>Nowruz</h1>
    <p>
      The first day of the Iranian calendar falls on the March equinox, the
      first day of spring, around March 21. In the 11th century CE the Iranian
      calendar was reformed in order to fix the beginning of the calendar year,
      i.e. Nowruz, at the vernal equinox. Accordingly, the definition of Nowruz
      given by the Iranian scientist Tusi was the following: "the first day of
      the official New Year [Nowruz] was always the day on which the sun entered
      Aries before noon."Nowruz is the first day of Farvardin, the first month
      of the Iranian solar calendar. The word Nowruz is a combination of Persian
      words نو now—meaning "new"—and ruz—meaning "day". Pronunciation varies
      among Persian dialects, with Eastern dialects using the pronunciation
      [nawˈɾoːz] (as in Dari and Classical Persian, whereas in Tajik, it is
      written as "Наврӯз" Navröz), western dialects [nowˈɾuːz], and Tehranis
      [noːˈɾuːz]. A variety of spelling variations for the word nowruz exist in
      English-language usage, including novruz, nowruz, nauruz and newroz.

      <p>
        Nowruz's timing in Iran is based on Solar Hijri algorithmic calendar,
        which is based on precise astronomical observations, and moreover use of
        sophisticated intercalation system, which makes it more accurate than
        its European counterpart, the Gregorian calendar.[42] Each 2820 year
        great grand cycle contains 2137 normal years of 365 days and 683 leap
        years of 366 days, with the average year length over the great grand
        cycle of 365.24219852. This average is just 0.00000026 (2.6×10−7) of a
        day shorter than Newcomb's value for the mean tropical year of
        365.24219878 days, but differs considerably more from the mean vernal
        equinox year of 365.242362 days, which means that the new year, intended
        to fall on the vernal equinox, would drift by half a day over the course
        of a cycle.

      <h3>Charshanbe Suri</h3>

        Charshanbe Suri is a prelude to the New Year.In Iran, it is celebrated
        on the eve of the last Wednesday before Nowruz. It is usually celebrated
        in the evening by performing rituals such as jumping over bonfires and
        lighting off firecrackers and fireworks.In Azerbaijan, where the
        preparation for Novruz usually begins a month earlier, the festival is
        held every Tuesday during four weeks before the holiday of Novruz. Each
        Tuesday, people celebrate the day of one of the four elements – water,
        fire, earth and wind.On the holiday eve, the graves of relatives are
        visited and tended.Iranians sing the poetic line "my yellow is yours,
        your red is mine", which means:((my weakness to you and your strength to
        me)) to the fire during the festival, asking the fire to take away
        ill-health and problems and replace them with warmth, health, and
        energy. Trail mix and berries are also served during the celebration.
        Spoon banging is a tradition observed on the eve of Charshanbe Suri,
        similar to the Halloween custom of trick-or-treating. In Iran, people
        wear disguises and go door-to-door banging spoons against plates or
        bowls and receive packaged snacks. In Azerbaijan, children slip around
        to their neighbors' homes and apartments on the last Tuesday prior to
        Novruz, knock at the doors, and leave their caps or little basket on the
        thresholds, hiding nearby to wait for candies, pastries and nuts.The
        ritual of jumping over fire has continued in Armenia in the feast of
        Trndez, which is a feast of purification in the Armenian Apostolic
        Church and the Armenian Catholic Church, celebrated forty days after
        Jesus's birth.

    <h4>Sizdah bedar</h4>
    <p>
      In Iran, the Nowruz holidays last thirteen days. On the thirteenth day of
      the New Year, Iranians leave their houses to enjoy nature and picnic
      outdoors, as part of the Sizdebedar ceremony. The greenery grown for the
      Haft-sin setting is thrown away, particularly into a running water. It is
      also customary for young single people, especially young girls, to tie the
      leaves of the greenery before discarding it, expressing a wish to find a
      partner. Another custom associated with Sizdah Bedar is the playing of
      jokes and pranks, similar to April Fools' Day
