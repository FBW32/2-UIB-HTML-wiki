        This article is about the programming language. For the software
        platform, see Java (software platform). For the software package
        downloaded from java.com, see Java Platform, Standard Edition. For other

        <strong>Java</strong> is a general-purpose programming language that is
        class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation
        dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers
        write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can
        run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
        recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
        that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the
        underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and
        C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of
        2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use
        according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web
        applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
        (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core
        component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference
        implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries
        were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May
        2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community
        Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU
        General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative
        implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for
        Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and
        IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

        The latest versions are Java 14, released in March 2020, and Java 11, a
        currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on
        September 25, 2018; Oracle released for the legacy Java 8 LTS the last
        free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will
        otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up
        to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend
        uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to
        unresolved security issues.[22] Since Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are no
        longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to
        the latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.
