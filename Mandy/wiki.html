    <h2>Boings Nightmare Aircraft</h2>

    <p>The 737 was the most successfull aircraft manufactured in Boingś history. 
        The beginning of the nightmare has its roots in the rivalry between Airbus 
        and Boing. For Airbus the flagship of the company is the Airbus 320 wheras Boing
        tries to cover the same Market with their flagship the 737.When Airbus announced
        an updated version of there flagship the A320, Boing had no choice but measuring 
        up with some innovation to their flagship too.
    </p>

    <h2>What happened</h2>

    <p>Fuel efficenicy is the keyword in the aviation world. So Airbus came up with 
        an idea of a new fuel efficient version of their aircraft. All they did was using 
        bigger engines. The aircrafts from Airbus are higher from the ground, so
        fitting the bigger engines underneath the wings was no problem for Airbus.
        Boing could not just copy the idea and fit bigger engines under their wings too, 
        as the aircraft is lower. So they came up with another idea to fit the engines.
    </p>

    <h2>The idea to use software</h2>

    <p>Boing came up with the idea to use software to help them to solve any
        construction issues on their aircarft. Because the bigger engines could not fit
        under the wings, the whole aerodynamic of the aircraft was not function 
        anymore. The aircraft nose pitched up and the software was supposed to 
        regulate this.
    </p>

<!-- We need to get better in Software development -->
    <h2>How good was the idea to rely entirely on the software</h2>

    <p>The software was malfunctioning twice. The pilots were not informed 
        about the functioning of the software and could not interfere with 
        it. Two crashes and several
        victims later, the aircraft was grounded.
    </p>

    <h2>Would it have been possible to avoid those victims?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Lion Air 189 died</li>
        <li>Ethiopian Airlines 157 died</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Those people could still be <em>allive</em>!!!</p>
    <p>We allways need to have a <strong>fallback plan</strong>!!!</p>
